I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Francis Crick Institute in London, working in the [Fr√∂hlich lab](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/fabian-frohlich). My research focuses on developing software and computational models to study dynamic biological systems. In particular, I am interested in the interplay between cell-cycle dynamics and signaling, the mechanisms governing cell and cell-structure size regulation, and how to integrate mechanistic and data-driven neural network models to investigate complex dynamic processes.

To facilitate efficient workflows when working with dynamic models, I have developed two Julia packages: [SBMLImporter.jl](https://github.com/sebapersson/SBMLImporter.jl) and [PEtab.jl](https://github.com/sebapersson/PEtab.jl). Further, in my modeling work I have used single-cell dynamic modeling to study nutrient signaling and reaction-diffusion models to investigate the size of self-assembled cellular structures in budding yeast.
